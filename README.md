# SgcApp
React App for IOT(Internet Of Things) project.

This documentation outlines the Internet of Things (IoT) project designed to address the specific challenges of our company, "SGC." SGC specializes in providing advanced technological solutions for the agricultural sector, with the goal of empowering farmers to make informed decisions and optimize both the quality and quantity of their crops. Our main priority is to promote sustainable agricultural practices and enhance efficiency in the process.

The repository associated with this project hosts a web application built with various key technologies, ensuring optimal performance and a robust user experience. The following are the technologies used:

1. **NodeJS:** Server-side JavaScript runtime platform that enables the development of scalable and efficient applications.

2. **Express:** Web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of robust and high-performance web applications.

3. **React:** JavaScript library for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces, providing a seamless user experience.

4. **MySQL:** Relational database management system that ensures efficient storage and retrieval of information.

In addition to the web application, the repository includes the code necessary to establish the connection between the ESP32 and the database. This component is essential for data collection, especially regarding humidity, which is obtained through a specific sensor. The collected information is presented in an accessible manner in the web application, allowing users to visualize and analyze real-time humidity data.

This comprehensive approach aims not only to address the current needs of our company but also to anticipate and adapt to future challenges in the agricultural sector. The combination of advanced technologies and the integration of devices like the ESP32 reflects our commitment to innovation and continuous improvement in the agro-industrial sector.
